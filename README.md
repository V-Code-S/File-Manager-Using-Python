**About File Explorer Project:**
In this project, we will develop a file explorer that will help us to save, open, rename, delete and move files and will also help in creating and deleting the folder.


**Python File Explorer Project**: 
The objective of this Python File Manager Project is to create our own File Explorer. Install tkinter and easygui to start developing the project.


**Project Prerequisites :**
Basic knowledge of tkinter and easygui is required to develop this project. Furthermore, knowledge of functions is also required.
Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.
EasyGUI is a module for very simple, very easy GUI programming in Python. EasyGUI is different from other GUI libraries in that EasyGUI is NOT event-driven. Instead, all GUI interactions are invoked by simple function calls. EasyGUI runs on Python 2 and 3, and does not have any dependencies beyond python and Tk.


**Project File Structure:**
1. Installing tkinter and easygui
2. Importing libraries
3. Save the File
4. Open the File
5. Renaming the file
6. Deleting a file
7. Copying a file
8. Deleting a folder
